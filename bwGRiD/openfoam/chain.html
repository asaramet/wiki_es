<h2>Chain an OpenFOAM job multiple times</h2>

<p>To run the same pbs script multiple times, in a chain, one after the other is finished,
  for example the walltime is exceeded, you may use a bash script as shown below.
</p>

<p>A job named <code>start_OF.qsub</code> will be submited to run 4 times one after another with
  the following bash script:
</p>

<pre>#!/usr/bin/env bash

pbs_script="start_OF.qsub"
number_of_jobs=4

submit=$(qsub ${pbs_script})
echo ${submit}

for id in seq 1 ${number_of_jobs}; do
submit=$(qsub -l depend=afternotok:${submit} ${pbs_script})
done</pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> the OpenFOAM case you run in the pbs script should be already
  decomposed and reconstructed only after all the jobs are finished
</p>
