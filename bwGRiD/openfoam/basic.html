<h1>OpenFOAM on bwGRiD Cluster, Esslingen</h1>

<h2>Access and basic usage</h2>
<p>To view which OpenFOAM modules are available on the cluster, run the
  following command:
</p>
<pre>$ module avail cae/openfoam</pre>

<p>To load the appropriate version (if available), run:</p>
<pre>$ module load cae/openfoam/&ltversion&gt</pre>

<p>where <code>&ltversion&gt</code> is the desired available OpenFOAM version to load.</p>

<p>After the module is loaded, OpenFOAM needs to be activated by running following:</p>
<pre>$ source $FOAM_INIT</pre>

<p>or simply:</p>
<pre>$ foamInit</pre>

<h2>Building an OpenFOAM batch file for parallel processing</h2>
<p>To run any job in a parallel mode with OpenFOAM, the geometry domain should be decomposed into
  segments, equal to the number of processors you intend to use. That means, for example, a mesh of
  a case which will run on 8 processors, must first be decomposed into 8 segments.
  Then the solver is run in <em>parallel</em> mode, concurrently on these 8 segments, each processor
  responding for one segment of the mesh, sharing the data with all other processors in between. There
  is a built in mechanism which properly connects the generated data on each segment to avoid the
  possible errors.
</p>

<p>Mesh decomposition is handled by <code>decomposePar</code> utility. The number of parts to decompose
  the geometry domain as well as the method to do so is defined in <code>system/decomposeParDict</code>
  file, in your OpenFOAM case folder.
</p>

<h2>OpenFOAM job scripts</h2>
<p><strong>Attention: </strong><code>openfoam</code> module loads automatically the necessary
  <code>openmpi</code> module for parallel run. Do <strong>NOT</strong> load another <code>openmpi</code>
  version, as it may conflict with the one software was configured with.
</p>

<p>A job script to submit a batch job called <em>job_openfoam.txt</em> that runs the <em>icoFoam</em>
  solver with OpenFOAM version 2.4.0, on 8 processors up to maximum 6 hours looks like:
</p>
<pre>#!/bin/bash
#number of processors to run a job ncpus=nodes*ppn
#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=8:mem24gb

#wall time (up to 24 hours)
#PBS -l walltime=06:00:00

#name of the job
#PBS -N test_icoFoam

#set a log file for job's output
#PBS -o parallelRun.log
#PBS -j oe

#send an e-mail when a job begins, aborts or ends
#PBS -m abe
#e-mail address specification
#PBS -M user@uni.de

#specify the OpenFOAM version and solver to run
OPENFOAM_VERSION="2.4.0"
EXECUTABLE="icoFoam"

#switches to the directory from which 'qsub' command run:
cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR

#load the OpenFOAM module and source it
module load cae/openfoam/$OPENFOAM_VERSION
source $FOAM_INIT

#start the solver
echo "Starting at: "
date

[[ !( -d logs) ]] && mkdir logs -p

decomposePar &&gt; logs/decomposePar.log &&
mpiexec $EXECUTABLE -parallel &&gt; logs/$EXECUTABLE.log &&
reconstructPar &&gt; logs/reconstructPar.log &&
rm -rf processor*

echo "Run completed at: "
date</pre>
