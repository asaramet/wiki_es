<h1>OpenFOAM on bwUniCluster 2.0</h1>
<h2>Accessing and basic usage</h2>

<p>To view which OpenFOAM modules are available on the cluster, run the
  following command:
</p>
<pre>$ module avail cae/openfoam</pre>

<p>or:</p>
<pre>$ module spider cae/openfoam</pre>

<p>To load the appropriate version (if available), run:</p>
<pre>$ module load cae/openfoam/&ltVERSION&gt</pre>

<p>where <code>&ltVERSION&gt</code> is the desired available OpenFOAM version to load.</p>

<p>After the module is loaded, OpenFOAM needs to be activated by running following:</p>
<pre>$ source $FOAM_INIT</pre>

<p>or simply:</p>
<pre>$ foamInit</pre>

<h2>Parallel processing with OpenFOAM</h2>
<p>To run any job in a parallel mode with OpenFOAM, the geometry domain should be decomposed into
  segments, equal to the number of processors you intend to use. That means, for example, a mesh of
  a case which will run on 8 processors, must first be decomposed into 8 segments.
  Then the solver is run in <em>parallel</em> mode, concurrently on these 8 segments, each processor
  responding for one segment of the mesh, sharing the data with all other processors in between. There
  is a built in mechanism which properly connects the generated data on each segment to avoid the
  possible errors.
</p>

<p>Mesh decomposition is handled by <code>decomposePar</code> utility. The number of parts to decompose
  the geometry domain as well as the method to do so is defined in <code>system/decomposeParDict</code>
  file, in your OpenFOAM case folder.
</p>

<h2>Specific domain decomposition and reconstruct on bwUniCluster 2</h2>
<p>Every node on bwUniCluster 2 has it's own SSD hardrive which if used will run havy data exchange
  aplications faster. OpenFOAM will profit using these local harddrives for parallel data processing.
</p>

<p>For this purpuse some specific wrappers are developed for bwUniCluster 2 to move data on
nodes local hardrives after domain decomposition and collect it back before reconstruct.
Using following commands:
</p>

<p>instead of <code>decomposePar</code></p>
<pre>decomposeParHPC</pre>

<p>instead of <code>reconstructPar</code></p>
<pre>reconstructParHPC</pre>

<p>instead of <code>reconstructParMesh</code></p>
<pre>reconstructParMeshHPC</pre>
