<h1>Licenses on bwUniCluster 2.0 for users from Hochschule Esslingen.</h1>

<p>Licenses for commercial software like ANSYS, or STAR-CCM+ for users from Esslingen
  University of Applied Sciences (HE), that a managed by a local license server, are
  not openly available on platforms other than the university handled ones.
</p>

<p>bwUniCluster being a HPC resource platform opened for users from different universities
  from Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, does not have direct access to the license servers from HE.
</p>

<p>Nonetheless, reaching the HE license servers resources is possible through SSH-tunneling.</p>

<h2 id="ssh-tunnel">Access and configuration over an SSH-tunnel.</h2>

<p>A SSH tunnel (also called SSH port forwarding) allows data exchange between bwUniCluster's
  specific nodes and a license server through an intermediate server/PC which has an SSH encrypted
  connection with bwUniCluster. (See the diagram below)
</p>

<p>In other words, you need a server or PC which can be accessed from bwUniCluster through SSH
  and is connected to the license server.
</p>

<p>For HE users such, a server is <code>comserver.hs-esslingen.de</code></p>

<p>So, in order to create any SSH tunnel from the cluster nodes to the license server you must
  first ensure that a valid connection exists from the bwUniCluster to the com server and it
  can be passwordless accessed through SSH key authentication.
</p>

<h3 id="ssh-key">Configure SSH key based secure authentication from bwUniCluster to the intermediate (com) server.</h3>
<p>1. Create a SSH public key.</p>

<p>If you don't have a SSH public key on bwUniCluster, create one with:</p>
<pre>ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -o -a 100</pre>

<p>Follow and fill the requested options. At the end you should have the following file created:</p>

<pre>$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</pre>

<p>2. Authorize SSH key authentication from bwUniCluster to HE comserver.</p>

<p>After you created the SSH public key. Run the following command from bwUniCluster:</p>

<pre>ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub &ltUSER_ID&gt@&ltCOM_HOSTNAME&gt</pre>

<p>where, <code>&ltUSER_ID&gt</code> is the HE user ID, and <code>&ltCOM_HOSTNAME&gt</code>
  is the intermediate server host name.
</p>

<p>In our case it is  <code>comserver.hs-esslingen.de</code></p>

<p>You'll be asked to provide the HE password for authentication on
  <code>comserver.hs-esslingen.de</code>.
</p>

<p>To verify if the SSH key based secure authentication have been successfully established,
  you may run the following command from bwUniCluster:
</p>

<pre>ssh &ltUSER_ID&gt@&ltCOM_HOSTNAME&gt</pre>

<p>If you get an SSH window of the &ltCOM_HOSTNAME&gt, without being asked for any password,
  you configured your SSH key based connection successfully. Congratulations.
</p>

<h3>Creating a SSH tunnel.</h3>
<p>1. Having access to the intermediate server with the host name <code>&ltCOM_HOSTNAME&gt</code>,
  user id <code>&ltUSER_ID&gt</code>
</p>

<p>2. Knowing that the intermediate server can connect to the license server with host name
  <code>&ltLCS_HOSTNAME&gt</code>, through port <code>&ltLCS_PORT&gt</code>
</p>

<p>It is possible to create an SSH tunnel through a free port <code>&ltLOCAL_PORT&gt</code>,
  with the following command:
</p>

<pre>ssh -MS tunnel-socket -fnNT -L &ltLOCAL_PORT&gt:&ltLCS_HOSTNAME&gt:&ltLCS_PORT&gt &ltUSER_ID&gt@&ltCOM_HOSTNAME&gt</pre>

<p>where, <code>tunnel-socket</code> will be the link to a temporary SSH control socket with the
  SSH tunnel running in background.
</p>

<p>The following command will check the process id of this socket:</p>

<pre>ssh -S tunnel-socket -O check &ltUSER_ID&gt@&ltCOM_HOSTNAME&gt</pre>

<p>To close the socket and the tunnel connection with it, do:</p>

<pre>ssh -S tunnel-socket -O exit &ltUSER_ID&gt@&ltCOM_HOSTNAME&gt</pre>
