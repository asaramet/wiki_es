<h1>Chain jobs</h1>
<p>Some jobs require more time to finish than the maximum walltime a single job is allowed to run.
  As a solution it is possible to run multiple jobs in a chain, meaning next job will start only
  if the previous one is completed.
</p>

<p><code>-d, --dependency=&ltdependency_list&gt</code> is an option for <code>sbatch</code> command
that deffer the start of this job until the specified dependencies have been satisfied / completed.
</p>

<p><code>&ltdependency_list&gt</code> is of the form
  <em>&lttype:job_id[:job_id][,type:job_id[:job_id]]&gt</em>
  or <em>&lttype:job_id[:job_id][?type:job_id[:job_id]]&gt</em>. All dependencies must be satisfied
  if ',' separator is used. And any dependency must be satisfied if '?' separator is used.
  Once a job dependency fails due to the termination state of preceding job, the depending job will
  never run.
</p>

<p>Some useful dependency types to use in &ltdependency_list&gt:</p>

<table class="describe">
  <tr>
    <th>Dependency</th>
    <th>Purpose</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>after:job_id[[+time][:job_id[+time]...]]</td>
    <td>After the specified jobs start or are canceled and 'time' in minutes from job start
      or cancelation happens, this job can begin execution. If no 'time' is given then there
      is no delay after start or cancelation.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>afterany:job_id[:job_id...]</td>
    <td>This job can start after specified jobs are over.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>afternotok:job_id[:job_id...]</td>
    <td>This job can start after specified jobs have terminated in some failed state.
      Ex: node failure, non-zero exit code, time out etc.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>afterok:job_id[:job_id...]</td>
    <td>This job can start after specified jobs executed successfully.
      Ex: completed with exit code of zero</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Knowing that a job submited with <code>sbatch</code> will output the following string:</p>

<pre>Submitted batch job JOB_ID</pre>

<p>It is possible to cut the string to get job ID into a variable named <code>job_id</code>
  with the following submit command, where <code>hello.sh</code> is the name of the job script
  you want to run:
</p>

<pre>job_id=$(sbatch hello.sh) && job_id=${job_id#'Submitted batch job '}</pre>

<p>Now you can run a <code>while</code> loop in a bash script to submit multiple chain jobs:</p>

<pre>#!/usr/bin/env bash

job_sbatch_script="hello.sh"

declare -i nr_of_jobs="5" # how many chain jobs you want to run

dependency_type="-d afterok"

declare -i loop_counter="1"
while [[ ${loop_counter} -le ${nr_of_jobs} ]]; do
  if [[ ${loop_counter} -eq 1 ]]; then
    sbatch_options=""
  else
    sbatch_options="${dependency_type}:${job_id}"
  fi

  job_id=$(sbatch ${sbatch_options} ${job_sbatch_script}) && job_id=${job_id#'Submitted batch job '}

  echo "Submitted batch job ${job_id}"
  loop_counter=$(( ${loop_counter} + 1 ))
done
</pre>
