<h2>File Systems</h2>
<p>In addition to high-performance computing resources, the bwUniCluster
  <a href="https://wiki.bwhpc.de/e/BwUniCluster_2.0_Hardware_and_Architecture">hardware architecture</a>
   includes a parallel hardware
  Lustre file system that is connected to the computing nodes via a high-end InfiniBand fiber-optic network.
</p>
<p>As a result, not all data is securely backed up or stored on the cluster. And you, the user, have to decide how best to
store your data to take full advantage of the parallel file system or the backup capabilities of the cluster.
</p>

<p>The following data storage systems are offered on the cluster with some recommendations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>$HOME folder - suitable for permanently required data. The user can access this folder from all cluster nodes and a
    regular backup of the data in this folder is carried out automatically. But it has a qouta limit. It is therfore recomended,
    that you keep in the $HOME directory the files that you regularly use. Like for example, configuration files, source code,
    executable programs, etc. <br><br>
    The default limit quota for the $HOME directory, on the cluster is 1 TiB and 10 million inodes (files or folders) per user.
    To check the current quota usage and limit, use the command:<br><br>
    <pre>$ lfs quota -uh $(whoami) $HOME</pre>

    In addition to the quota limit per user, there is a limit per university, which is based on the financial share of
    the universities for the bwUniCluster. The following command will show your this quota: <br><br>
    <pre>lfs quota -ph $(grep $(echo $HOME | sed -e "s|/[^/]*/[^/]*$||") /pfs/data5/project_ids.txt | cut -f 1 -d\ ) $HOME</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Workspaces - a parallel file system designed for parallel data access and high throughput of large files. It is able to
    provide parallel data access with transfer rates of up to 54 GB/s for writing and reading. It is perfectly designed for storing large, non-permanent data sets,
    e.g. restarting files or output data that have to be post-processed. <br><br>
    Workspaces have a lifetime, and when it expires, the data on it is permanently removed. The maximum lifespan of a workspace is 60 days, but it can be extended
    three times at the end of this period for a maximum of 240 days after the workspace is created.
    If a workspace accidentally expires, the data can still be restored for a limited time (a few weeks).
    In this case you should create a new workspace and state the name of the new and the expired one in a ticket or by e-mail to the bwUniCluster hotline.<br><br>

    You can find more information about creating and managing workspaces <a href="https://wiki.bwhpc.de/e/Workspace">here</a>. <br><br>
 </li>
 <li>$TMP folder - a local node directory on bwUniCluster. While all tasks of a parallel application access the same $HOME and Workspace directory, the $TMP
   directory is only local to the specific node on the cluster. Different tasks of a parallel application may and should use different directories in a multi-node run.
   This is exactly the folder that should be used for temporary files accessed by individual tasks. All nodes have fast SSDs local storage devices that are used to
   store data in $TMP.
 </li>
</ul>
